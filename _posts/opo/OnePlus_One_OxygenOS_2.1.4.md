Whereas many operating systems have fallen victim to an infestation of abrasive bloatware, OxygenOS 2.1.4 offers a clean, unburdened overall user experience. Now, because no two devices are the same, we inevitably had to deviate slightly from feature parity with the OnePlus 2. MaxxAudioâ€™s proprietary sound technology and relevant applications were removed. The manual camera mode and RAW file format capability also did not make the final cut. For obvious reasons, there is no fingerprint support, nor a screen temperature slider. Beyond these concessions, you will be able to enjoy a version of OxygenOS that has been fully optimized for the OnePlus One.

OnePlus One users will benefit from other features unique to OxygenOS. Try Dark Mode to give your device a touch of elegance, or choose the accent color that suits your mood. Custom icon packs are also supported. With our App Permissions feature, you are in control over what information each app has access to. Finally, double tap to wake and all the other gestures you know and love can be toggled in the settings.
