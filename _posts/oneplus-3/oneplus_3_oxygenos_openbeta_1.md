* Several UI improvements
* New and improved OnePlus apps, including clock, weather, and file manager
* Improved camera software
* More robust settings and and customization features

You’ll notice some of these new features right away, but the big changes have taken place behind the scenes. We’ve streamlined our platform, and OxygenOS 3.5 includes a lot of backend enhancements that will streamline our processes. The big goal here is to improve the speed and frequency of updates moving forward.

*** Note: If you flash this Open Beta build, you’ll receive Open Beta OTAs (but not official OTAs). You’ll need to manually (clean) flash back to our official builds to continue receiving official OTAs. Rolling back to official OxygenOS versions require wiping data and cache.*
