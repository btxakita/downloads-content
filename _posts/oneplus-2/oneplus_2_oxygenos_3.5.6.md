*** Attention: If updated to 3.5.5, basic functions like WiFi connectivity, Network and Fingerprint might be affected if users want to flash back to 3.1.0. This has to be dealt with with a special tool to clear all data from the phone. You must backup your data if you want to revert to older versions from 3.5.5.*

*** To downgrade from 3.5.5 to 3.1.0, please refer to our Flashing Guide here for the necessary files and steps to perform this process: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1adh17i1Xrm2uo8DI4E7ykWc_8MS9vFF8zsVaQZaIVww/edit?usp=sharing*
